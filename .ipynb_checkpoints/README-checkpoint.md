## OUTLINE/DESCRIPTION
```
Compare 2020 Stock market to major stock market shifts to determine probable outcomes of 2020 based on the most comparable stock market crashes since 1900.
```

## RESEARCH QUESTIONS
1. What crash in the last 120 years is most correlated to the crash in 2020 (redefine based on how far back can we look)?
2. Are we anticipating a Bear or Bull Market by 12/31/2020?
3. What 3 sectors have been most affected and 3 most resilient?
3.1 What would be a profitable portfolio coming out of this?
4. Alternative: What indicators are inversely correlated to the stock market crash?
5. Utilizing Monte Carlo, what are probable outcomes of those 3 sectors assuming no Fed involvement?
6. Utilizing Monte Carlo, what are probable outcomes of those 3 sectors assuming Fed involvement?


## DATA SETS
[FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) (Federal Reserve Economic Data) data set - User-friendly database of U.S. and international time series data maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
